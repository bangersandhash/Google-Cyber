Write a login automation:

# Define a function named `login` that takes in two parameters, `username` and `device_id`
def login(username, device_id):
    # If `username` belongs to `approved_users`,
    if username in approved_users:
        # then display "The user ______ is approved to access the system.",
        print("The user", username, "is approved to access the system.")
        # assign `ind` to the index of `username` in `approved_users`,
        ind = approved_users.index(username)
        # and execute the following conditional
        # If `device_id` matches the element at the index `ind` in `approved_devices`,
        if device_id == approved_devices[ind]:

    # Otherwise (part of the outer conditional and handles the case when `username` does not belong to `approved_users`),
    else:

        print("The username", username, "is not approved to access the system.")
